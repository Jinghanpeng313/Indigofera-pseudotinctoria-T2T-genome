# Indigofera pseudotinctoria Haplotype-Resolved Genome Analyses Pipeline

This repository documents the main analyses from the “A haplotype-resolved T2T genome assembly of Indigofera pseudotinctoria reveals the genetic basis of flavonoid biosynthesis in Chinese Indigo”, including:

- T2T haplotype-resolved genome assembly
- Structural variation (SV) and transposable element (TE) analysis
- Allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis
- Phylogenomics and WGD detection
- Integrated transcriptomic–metabolomic flavonoid analysis
